# TawktoBlocker
Tawk.to Blocker by SM mest3r
Tired of browsing websites in peace, but more and more websites are using the Tawk.to widget? There's nothing wrong with it, but I'm particularly annoyed that it crawls into my face and even sends a notification sound. Plus there are a lot of sites using it where I never need it. That's why I made this extension for chromium browsers. 

It's pretty easy to install, but here's a video how to install it. (I'm using Opera GX, but you need to do almost the same steps in other chromium browsers too. It's not much to think about.) https://storage1.cubehost.hu/index.php/s/dH9zmtAjpR648qT
